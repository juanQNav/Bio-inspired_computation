# Bio-Inspired Computation

This repository contains the work for the Bio-Inspired Computation course. In the ISI program at UASLP.

## Content
The repository is organized by partials and includes:

### **Parcial 1**
- **ACO_cities/**: Implementation of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with different datasets.
- **Exam1/**: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) applied to the "Ambitious Thief" problem.
- **PSO_rastrigin_function/**: PSO applied to optimize the Rastrigin function.
- **Problems_PSO/**: Various problems solved using PSO.

### **Parcial 2**
- **Exam2/**: Genetic Algorithm (GA) applied to the Iris dataset.
- **rastrigin_function_GA/**: GA applied to optimize the Rastrigin function.
- **thief_GA/**: GA applied to the "Ambitious Thief" problem.

### **Parcial 3**
- **Symbolic_Regression/**: Symbolic Regression using Genetic Programming.
- **Exam3/**: Further symbolic regression experiments.

## Requeriments
To run the scripts, the following libraries need to be insatalled:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for some analyses)
- Pandas
- Tqdm 
- others

To install the required dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas tqdm
```
